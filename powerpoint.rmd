## Background

- Breast Cancer Diagnosis Data
- Predict Diagnosis of Tumor based on features
- Reduce Type II Error (False-Negatives)
- Feature Selection

## Data

- Data collected from Kaggle
- Response: Diagnosis (Benign/Malignant)
- Mean, SE, and "Worst" measurements of 10 variables
- Training/Test Split (60/40)

## Features

- 
- 

## EDA

Different measurements of each variable are correlated

Relationship with Diagnosis visible for each measurement
